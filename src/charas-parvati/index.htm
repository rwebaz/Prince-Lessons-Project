      <p>
        <span>Dear friends:</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Many years ago as a youngster I was traveling around the globe and one day I found myself in the beautiful Parvati Valley of Northern India.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>No words can describe the intense happiness I felt that moment finding myself locked in a personal center of the universe flying free as a bird gliding through creation and the colorful swirls of my mind.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>But, there I was, listening to the wind playing with the leaves and recognizing the magical sound of countless exotic birds singing to me in the most beautiful cacophony of Mother Nature ever recorded.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>I have been searching for that same bliss ever since then and today that feeling is within our grasp once again.</span>
      </p>
  
      <p>
        <span>In the year #2007, an even more potent source of Charas genetics was found!</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Shortly thereafter, we succeeded in hybridizing what we believe is the one and only truly <em>Charas parvati</em> experience.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Today, we are living in a magnificent time ...</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>For we believe we have succeeded in stabilizing the original Cannabis landrace varietal known as ...</span>
      </p>

        <span>When selecting seeds-to-plant, think of the amount of time it will take to eventually bear ripe flowers.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Some auto-devils sprout flowers right off the bat concurrent with the vegetative phase.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>While still other strains are prone to hermaphrodism.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Unless you have a couple of zillion Bitcoin stashed away in a private hard wallet that no one knows about, you will probably want to get as much bang for your buck as possible.</span>

        <span>The following table shows some parameters you may wish to keep in mind when purchasing Grade A achenes from the Netherlands.</span>
